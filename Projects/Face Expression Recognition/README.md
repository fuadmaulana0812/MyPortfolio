# Face Expression Recognition

### Objective
Objective of the project is to detect facial expressions. Expressions detect such as angry, disgust, neutral, happy, surprise, fear, and sad. This system can be very helpful to detection of customer satisfaction based on facial expressions that appear.

### Dataset
I use [Facial Expression Recognition](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=t&id=1b4DZIS7VfBI_V8-DbpsaCP0ij8u1K3hJ) dataset where the data is in the form of facial images that have been done with a grayscale process. The dataset used has been divided into 2 folders, namely train and validation.

The dataset consist of train and validation with a total 28821 images of train data and 7066 images of validation data. With the distribution of labels or expressions in the data train as follows
