# Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Portfolio - Fuad Maulana
My name is Fuad Maulana and I'm from Indonesia. I love Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I have experience about Data Scraping, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, ChatGPT, and others. I'm still learn more and improve my skill in Data and AI field. This portfolio is compilation of all the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence projects I have done for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

In this project I created a tensorflow model architecture to predict facial expressions from facial image. The expression consists is angry, fear, neutral, happy, surprise, sad, and disgust. The goal of this project is to detect facial emotion on image. This model can be used in several ways, one of which is to determine customer satisfaction through facial expressions in images

In this project I created several models to predict whether someone is eligible for a loan or not based on a person's ability and history in paying off his loan. I have 2 projects. In the first project using several models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine. While the second project uses Tensorflow model.
